Why can't we get work done at work.



Over collaboration:
How do we get more time to think?

Slack - too many notifications? 

Real work gets done when people have reall stretches of uninterupted time.

Problems - managers and meetings

Meetings should be a last resort.



Artists have time to create

Too much collaboration can be just politics



Collaborate on your own schedule



Forced breaks in workflow is toxic
